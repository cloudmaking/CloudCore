# CloudCore - an open source DAW

Clone or download the repo > double click the html file > start making music!

## What is CloudCore?
A free digital audio workstation (DAW) that runs in your browser. It's a work in progress, but it's already pretty fun to use. I am thinking of building it with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) adn other web music modules {if you have any suggestion please do leave them as an issue or dm me}. still in the early days though. i am willing to accept pull requests and help from anyone who wants to contribute. this will be a long journey, but i am excited to see where it goes.

## How to use it
- Clone or download the repo
- Run the html file in your browser
- make music!

Alternatively you can use the hosted version on [my website](https://www.downbad.cloud/CloudCore/) *Once version 1.0 is ready*

## What can it do?
For not not much but in the future it will be able to record mic and midi input and play back audio files. it will also have a sequencer and a mixer. i am also thinking of adding a synth and a sampler.

## What is the goal?
The goal is to make a free, open source, and easy to use DAW that runs in your browser. i am also hoping to make it a platform for other developers to build on top of. i am thinking of adding a plugin system so that other developers can add their own plugins to the DAW. i am also thinking of adding a way for users to share their projects with each other.

## How can you help?
If you are a developer and you want to help, you can contribute to the project by adding features, fixing bugs, or improving the code. if you are not a developer, you can help by testing the DAW and giving me feedback. you can also help by spreading the word about the project. if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
